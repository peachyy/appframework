	/////////////////////// Animation 
	
	public String param;   // 	This attribute lets you specify the property of chart object which you want to animate e.g., _x, _y, _xscale etc..
	public String start;   // 	The start value of animation e.g., if you're animating the data plot for fade in alpha effect, the start value of alpha would be 0.
	public String duration;   // 	Using this, you can control the duration of animation in seconds.
	public String easing;   // 	This attribute lets you specify the pattern of animation easing. Valid values are "elastic", "bounce", "regular", "strong" or "none".
	
	
	
	////////////////////  Shadow

	public String strength;   // 	The strength of the imprint or spread. The higher the value, the more color is imprinted and the stronger the contrast between the shadow and the background. Valid values are from 0 to 255. The default is 1.
	public String quality;   // 	The number of times to apply the shadow effect. Valid values are 0 to 15. The default value is 1, which is equivalent to low quality. A value of 2 is medium quality, and a value of 3 is high quality. Shadow with lower values are rendered quicker.
